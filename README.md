This is my personal website :tada:

## Installation

A mess tbh. Currently runs on [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/). Working on cleaning this up and possibly containerizing it.

## Todo
- Rework the whole website to run as a container
  - ~~Run Caddy locally in a container~~
  - ~~Setup my website inside this local container~~
  - Try running the website in ECS or something?
  - Evaluate if a container is a better way to run my website (cost, ease of deployment, etc.)


## Future
- Add pre-commit to this repo
- Run my website off IPv6
- Fix the top-level folder organization to have the html pages in a folder, but still work with templating
- Integrate my CBB bracket and SLP ideas into the website, possible as subdomains


## Done
- Added a bunch of kooky joke pages
- Edited my main page summary a billion times
- Constantly flip flopped on whether or not to have my face on the site

Currently running with just the Caddy server.

You can edit the Caddyfile, somehow, but I'm not touching it.
file is: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

I am now tracking this Caddyfile in git, so in the future, copy over the git version onto the /etc version of the file to update it. No, symbolic links don't work.



Useful commands:
sudo systemctl restart caddy
systemctl status caddy | less
sudo cp Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

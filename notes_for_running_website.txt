Currently running with just the Caddy server.

You can edit the Caddyfile, somehow, but I'm not touching it.
file is: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

I am now tracking this Caddyfile in git, so in the future, copy over the git version onto the /etc version of the file to update it. No, symbolic links don't work.


Locally, I built Caddy from source on Mar 2nd 2020. It was release v2.0.0-beta.15. This went reasonably well, but then I had trouble getting it built from source on the Ubuntu EC2, probably because the EC2 is old. So I am going to skip upgrading to Caddy 2 for now, and switch to using Caddy 1 for local development (installed via homebrew).

In the long-term future if the site ever sees real traffic, it might make sense to duplicate the AWS ECS structure as a dev environment. Everything from a new NLB onwards down the line. But for now, I think it's okay to test the website container locally and then publish it when I think it's ready. Seems like a lot more work to builds a separate pipeline, not to mention a guaranteed extra $25 per month from the second NLB.

Seems like a good time to note, almost all of the cost is from having an NLB. That's $25 per month right away. The actual compute is pretty cheap at only a few bucks per month since I'm running a `t3a.micro`.

If the NLB ever gets destroyed, you might need to update the DNS, if it gets a new elastic IP.

Useful commands:
sudo systemctl restart caddy
systemctl status caddy | less
sudo cp Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

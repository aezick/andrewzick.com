Currently running with just the Caddy server.

You can edit the Caddyfile, somehow, but I'm not touching it.
file is: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

I am now tracking this Caddyfile in git, so in the future, copy over the git version onto the /etc version of the file to update it. No, symbolic links don't work.


Locally, I built Caddy from source on Mar 2nd 2020. It was release v2.0.0-beta.15. This went reasonably well, but then I had trouble getting it built from source on the Ubuntu EC2, probably because the EC2 is old. So I am going to skip upgrading to Caddy 2 for now, and switch to using Caddy 1 for local development (installed via homebrew).


Useful commands:
sudo systemctl restart caddy
systemctl status caddy | less
sudo cp Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

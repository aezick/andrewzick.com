					<h1>Computer Security</h1>
					<br>
					<p>Twitter is a great place for peeking at what's on the mind of the security community, not to mention most of them are pretty nice. <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity" target="_blank">SwiftOnSecurity</a> mixes in jokes with topical security commentary and often conversations they start will have lots of important security people from around the web chiming in.</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you're eager to jump into security but don't feel adequately prepared, check out <a href="http://thesecuritysetup.com/" title="The Security Setup website" target="_blank">The Security Setup</a>. It's dedicated to interviewing people from the security community about what hardware/software they use and it's chock full of useful information, from easy changes like installing an adblocker (I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm" title="uBlock Origin website" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a>) and enforcing <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" title="HTTPS Everywhere website" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a>.

					<br>
					<p>Now that you're ready, the best way to dive into the field is to start completing CTFs, or Capture the Flags, special computer security events held to test how you apply security skills to computer problems. <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/" title="CTFTime website" target="_blank">CTF Time</a> does a better job explaining what kinds of challenges you'll see in CTFs and hosts a calendar with future CTFs that you can participate in. Here's  a list of CTFs in no particular order:</p>

					<p>I also have a particular interest in password security. I use <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/" title="Hashcat website" target="_blank">Hashcat</a> and a modified version of the <a href="https://crackstation.net/" title="Crackstation website" target="_blank">CrackStation</a> wordlist for dictionary attacks on my own passwords for fun because if my <i>CPU</i> can crack it then I shouldn't be using it for a password! Also you should sign up for <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" title="HaveIBeenPwned website" target="_blank">Have I Been Pwned?</a> if you haven't already. It notifies you any time your email address appears in a company's database leak so you can go change the password right away. Here's a bunch of great resources on passwords:</p>

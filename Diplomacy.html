					<h1>Diplomacy</h1>

					<p>My current internet hobby is playing and running games of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">Diplomacy</a>, a 7 player asymmetric board game similar to Risk but without the luck. Diplomacy has been around long enough to have been played via several different mediums including mail, email, IRC, moving on later to <a href="https://webdiplomacy.net/index.php">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.backstabbr.com/">different</a> websites, and even <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badfrog.conspiracy.app&hl=en_US&gl=US">an Android app</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I did say running, yes. I am part of the team behind Nexus Leagues which helps organize games for whoever wants to play. We craft game rosters, manage player needs, and just generally keep things running smoothly so everyone can have a good time. You can join our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/DfDkhQeraE">via this link</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>My favorite way to play Diplomacy is a rules variant called "Speedboat". That's the "gunboat" variant, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunboat_diplomacy#:~:text=In%20international%20politics%2C%20the%20term,agreeable%20to%20the%20superior%20force.">gunboat diplomacy</a>, which means no sending messages to other players, and "speed" which means 5 minute turns. This variant is all about testing how fast you can read and react to the board, akin to the pressures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Blitz">Blitz Chess</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Any sufficiently fanatic hobby develops its own version of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin's Law</a>. For experienced Diplomacy players, every discussions comes back to scoring systems. Simply put, the goal of Diplomacy is to capture at least 18 out of the 34 total supply centers. That is a solo win or simply a "Solo". This is generally quite hard to do and so people have quite reasonably created other ways to evaluate player performance. There is an excellent post about Diplomacy Scoring Systems <a href="http://www.petermc.net/blog/2020/12/10/diplomacy-scoring-systems/">located here</a> for anyone interested.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Nexus Leagues staff were no better at resisting this flashpoint and created our own scoring system called "Open Mind the Gap" or "OMG" for short. If you happen to be using OMG scoring, I created an online calculator for it <a href="https://diplomacy-things.gitlab.io/diplomacy-score-calculators/">that lives here</a>. If you are using a different scoring system, the Diplomacy Broadcast Network has a similar calculator (I helped!) on its <a href="https://diplobn.com/scoring-system-calculator/">website here</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>My calculator is hosted at no cost to me via <a href="https://gitlab.com/diplomacy-things/diplomacy-score-calculators">Gitlab</a>.</p>

					<h1>Diplomacy</h1>

					<p>My current internet hobby is playing and running games of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">Diplomacy</a>, a 7 player asymmetric board game similar to Risk but without the luck. Diplomacy has been around long enough to have been played via several different mediums including mail, email, IRC, moving on later to <a href="https://webdiplomacy.net/index.php">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.backstabbr.com/">different</a> websites, and even <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badfrog.conspiracy.app&hl=en_US&gl=US">an Android app</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I am part of the team behind "Nexus Leagues" which organizes press and gunboat games for anyone who wants to play. We focus on player consistency and healthy competition. You can join our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/DfDkhQeraE">via this link</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>My favorite way to play Diplomacy is a variant called "Speedboat". That's the "gunboat" variant, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunboat_diplomacy#:~:text=In%20international%20politics%2C%20the%20term,agreeable%20to%20the%20superior%20force.">gunboat diplomacy</a>, which means no sending messages to other players, and "speed" via 5 minute turns. It's all about testing how fast you can read and react to the board. It's a similar relationship to classical chess and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Blitz">blitz chess</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Any sufficiently fanatic hobby develops its own version of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">Godwin's Law</a>. For Diplomacy, it's scoring systems. The goal of Diplomacy is supposed to be capturing 18+ of the 34 supply centers. That is a win aka a "Solo". This is generally quite hard to do and so people have quite reasonably created other ways to evaluate player performance. There is an excellent post about Diplomacy Scoring Systems <a href="http://www.petermc.net/blog/2020/12/10/diplomacy-scoring-systems/">located here</a> for anyone interested.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Nexus Leagues staff were no better at resisting this temptation and created our own scoring system called "Open Mind the Gap" or "OMG" for short. That worked well, but particularly for gunboat, and so we've created another system for press called Duct Tape Scoring or DCTS. If you happen to be using OMG or DCTS, I've created an online calculator for it <a href="https://diplomacy-things.gitlab.io/diplomacy-score-calculators/">that lives here</a>. If you are using a different scoring system, the Diplomacy Broadcast Network has a similar calculator (I helped with the URL bit!) on its <a href="https://diplobn.com/scoring-system-calculator/">website here</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>My calculator is hosted at no cost to me thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/diplomacy-things/diplomacy-score-calculators">Gitlab</a> (and a CORS proxy).</p>
					<br>
					In an effort to gather common hobby terminology, I've also created the <a href="https://diplomacy-things.gitlab.io/glossary/">Diplomacy Glossary</a>. Thank you to everyone who contributed to it!

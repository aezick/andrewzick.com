**I've set out to containerize my website for fun and knowledge.

I've been running my website on a EC2 since 2016. Except rebooting for the rare security update that I remember to install, it's never been turned off. This has been fine, even exciting and incredibly convenient when I needed to do something best suited for Linux. I've had a great time learning HTML, CSS, and JS. I had less of a great time fumbling with DNS records, HTTP servers, and SFTP. But all-around it's been a great hobby to keep poking at interesting software.

From 2016 to the present day (2020-05-04) I've graduated from college, got a job, dedicated myself to college basketball, moved across the country, and my website changed with me. It's added more styling, more pages (mostly jokes), better Caddy configuration, a smidgen of documentation, and some thankfully unreleased content.

Now it's ready for the next step.

Most of my work is abstracted away from the infrastructure/devops side of things. The most common way we interact with running our applications is measuring performance to make sure that new changes don't slow things down. That's a healthy layer of abstraction for our organization. It doesn't satisfy my curiosity. Thus it has become very clear that the next step for my website is to stuff it inside of a Docker container.

Some possible questions:
What exactly are you doing? - I'm not sure. Just know that at the end of this, this website will be served by a Docker container. The rest will reveal itself as required.
Why not a different kind of container? - I'm familiar with Docker, to some extent.
As a potential visitor to your website, what changes will I see? - Hopefully none. Or rather, nothing negative. Possibly these posts to document the process.

This is all to say, hey, I'm going to attempt to do this thing, I think it will be interesting, and I'm going to try to remember to chronicle my adventures. Anything that anyone else gets out of it is a bonus! And I'm happy to answer any questions about the process, should someone read this. Sharing is caring, after all.

Wish me luck!

P.S. I'm using the ISO 8601 date format to help increase my familiarity with it. I'm not trying to be weird intentionally...more accidentally. It's the same reason my phone clock is set to 24 hour time.

I did not know what I was getting myself into.
